    <h3>Q:1)What is box sizing?</h3>
    <p>The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.</p>
    <p>If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height:</p>
    <div class="div1">Both divs are the same size now!</div>
    <br>
    <div class="div2">Hello World!</div>
    <br>
    <h3>Q:2)What is animation delay?</h3>
    <p>The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.</p>
    <p>The animation-delay value is defined in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).</p>
    <p>Example of Animation with delay 2s</p>
    <div class="anim"></div>

    <h3>Q:3)Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?</h3>
    <p>The grid-column property specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout, and is a shorthand property for the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>grid-column-start</li>
        <li>grid-column-end</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q:4)Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid?</h3>
    <p>The grid-row property specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout, and is a shorthand property for the following properties::</p>
    <ul>
        <li>grid-row-start</li>
        <li>grid-row-end</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q:5)what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?</h3>
    <p>visibility:hidden hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.</p>
    <p>display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space.</p>
